# System Geometry
Below is the geometry of the CZT Dual Panel system. The system is made up of 4 x 4 x 0.5 cm<sup>3</sup> cadmium zinc telluride (CZT) crystals.

Each panel consists 5 columns of 30 CZT crystals stacked on top of one another. The crystals are oriented in an edge-on configuration which allows for 4 cm of CZT thickness in the panel. The area of the panel face is 15 x 20 cm<sup>2</sup> while the distance between the panels is 20 cm.
