  File Naming
1)    Name of the input file              = sc442Ps_dcs
2)    Added Modifier to the output name   = 


  Defining the Source Space
-    X-limits = -20.0 , 20.0
-    Y-limits = -20.0 , 20.0
-    Z-limits = -20.0 , 20.0

-    The number of voxels per dimension x,y,z = 40, 40, 40
-    The number of theads per iteration block = 256
-    The number of iteration blocks           = 250
  THE NUMBER OF VOXELS MUST EQUAL THE NUMBER OF ITERATION THREADS

  Defining the Event Data
-    The total number of imported cones       = 10000
-    The number of theads per cone block      = 80
-    The number of cone blocks                = 125
  THE NUMBER OF CONES MUST EQUAL THE NUMBER OF CONE THREADS

  Run Length and Saves
-    The total number of iterations     = 20
-    The number of iterations per save  = 1

  Other Parameters
-    The number of steps for numerical integration, must be even    = 10
-    The Noise Reducing Cuttoff as a fraction of the maximum value  = 0.001
-    The assumed uncertainty in the energy measurements in MeV      = 0.01

  Method of Saving Data (Can have more than one selected)
-    DAT files in the same format as those produced by CORE = 0
-    CSV files to be used in Matthew's plotting codes       = 1
